# PyAutoGUI Automation 

This repository contains automation scripts built using [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/), a Python library that allows you to programmatically control the mouse and keyboard.  
It can be used for automating repetitive tasks, GUI testing, or creating simple bots.
